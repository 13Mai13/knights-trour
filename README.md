# knights-trour

## Intro

The goal of this project is to present a problem that can be executed with different algorithms so memory and CPU profining can be explored in python. 

## Problem presentation

You have NxN board, where each cell has a weight. A knight is placed at the starting point and must reach a target position, moving in an L shape. 

### Objective

* The objective is to collect the maxiumn amount of points: but watch out! The fastest you arrive (less steps you take) more rewarded you are f(x) = (number of points) / (number of steps)
